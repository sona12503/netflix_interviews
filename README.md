**🔍 The Plot Twist**
Turns out Netflix has been lying to us (well, kinda). What they call "movies" includes:

🎤 10-minute Obama interviews

🎥 Behind-the-scenes bloopers

🤳 Red carpet selfie compilations

After my investigation, 142 fake "movies" got busted. That's 2.3% of their whole catalog!
**Fun Findings**
Shortest "Movie": 10 min (Obamas being wholesome)

Most Creative Label: "Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Lab Outtakes" as a "Documentary"

Sneakiest Entry: "The Rock Eats a Burrito" (9 min) classified as "Action/Adventure"
